Ich hatte selten so schlechte KopfhÃ¶rer auf. Selbst bei Basslastiger Goa Musik war der Bass sehr schwach und die Mitten und hÃ¶hen viel zu aufdringlich. Ich habe seit zwei Jahren ein 10â‚¬ Bluetooth Headset das deutlich Besseren klang hat! Das wollte ich ersetzen da ich stÃ¤ndig Pairing Probleme habe. Dieses Produkt ist kein Ersatz. Ich frag mich wirklich wie andere diese schlechten KopfhÃ¶rer als gut empfinden kÃ¶nnen!"

El uso es ocasional, comprÃ© un case para no jalarlos, los uso 1-2 veces al dÃ­as para reuniones, no viajo en transporte publico con ellos, creo que hasta los cuido.Que sea marca JBL no garantiza nada, por el resultado, mejor comprar algunos chinos Xiaomi por $110."

Lo Ãºnico malo que les encuentro es el diseÃ±o circular del cable, ya que siento que son mÃ¡s frÃ¡giles que los T290 que tienen el cable plano, asÃ­ que recomendarÃ­a tener cuidado con ellos para que no se daÃ±en rÃ¡pidamente."

Ich hatte selten so schlechte KopfhÃ¶rer auf. Selbst bei Basslastiger Goa Musik war der Bass sehr schwach und die Mitten und hÃ¶hen viel zu aufdringlich. Ich habe seit zwei Jahren ein 10â‚¬ Bluetooth Headset das deutlich Besseren klang hat! Das wollte ich ersetzen da ich stÃ¤ndig Pairing Probleme habe. Dieses Produkt ist kein Ersatz. Ich frag mich wirklich wie andere diese schlechten KopfhÃ¶rer als gut empfinden kÃ¶nnen!"
