These have averaged over 1.5 years with over 6-7 hours of everyday use and it is truly rough and tough / careless usage (pulling on the wire, swinging ear buds hitting floor and bouncing back at times kinda use.) Decent build quality and good sound, mic quality with good warranty support makes it a decent and worthy purchase. Not for audiophiles though. This is the default \"that'll do\" product from a trusted brand.EDIT : Received Feb 2023 make product. Thickness of wire have reduced overtime but this is the first time I am purchasing this online. Everything else feels ok. I really hope it's the genuine product."

At first one of the ear isnt working, then a few weeks later it both stops.At 30ish $ and branded for kids, I expected a lot more. I can't understand how this product got a 9000+ positive review, in my experience this was a waste of money.Updated â€”â€”â€”I got an email about my unfortunate experience and got a chance to evaluate this product once again.
